/**
 * LimoSchedule browser push service worker.
 *
 * Deliberately generic — every piece of content (title, body, icon, badge,
 * url, type, booking_id) comes from the push payload itself, built
 * server-side by App\Services\PushNotificationService for every send. This
 * file never hardcodes a URL, an asset path, or branding, so an admin
 * changing the site logo or a route changing structure needs zero changes
 * here.
 *
 * Must be served from the site root (not /build/ or a subpath) — a service
 * worker's scope defaults to its own directory, and this app has pages
 * under /admin, /account (customer), and /driver that all need it.
